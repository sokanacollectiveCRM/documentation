# Sokana CRM Introduction

Welcome to Sokana CRM! This webpage will serve as guide for the Sokana CRM project, including details on how to get it up and running, as well as current progress and insights.

## Overview

The goal of Sokana CRM is to provide a CRM alternative to eDoula.biz. Our website will expand on it by introducing features like:

- **Client Log-in**: Giving clients a way to stay up-to-date with their services.
- **Quickbooks Integration**: Automating invoices and securing customer privacy
- **Drag and Drop**: Making the website easy to use
- **More robust notifications**: Keeping the admins more in touch with client-doula status.

This is on top of our foundational features:

- **PDF creation**
- **Status Tracking**
- **Separate Powers and Roles**
- **Client Information and Storage**
- **Hours Log**
- **Team Management**
- and more...

The progress we've made will be detailed in the **handoff documentation**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Template**: A React-based application template using Typescript. This section contains all the logic for routing and UI elements.
- **Backend Template**: An Express.js server template with database integration, authentication, and API scaffolding

Our template uses a modern TypeScript stack:

### Frontend

- React for UI components
- React Router v7 for navigation
- Supabase for authentication

### Backend

- Node.js and Express for the server
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for database
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

### Development Tools

- Git for version control
- VS Code as the recommended editor
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent code formatting
