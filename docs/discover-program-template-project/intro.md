# Sokana CRM Introduction

Welcome to the Sokana CRM codebase! This guide will serve to help you get the project up and running, and it will provide details on tech stack + next steps.

## Overview

The DISCover Program Template Project provides a standardized web application structure that combines modern technologies and best practices. It consists of two main components:

- **Frontend Template**: A React-based application template using Typescript. This section contains all the logic for routing and UI elements.
- **Backend Template**: An Express.js server template with database integration, authentication, and API scaffolding

## Tech Stack

Our template uses a modern TypeScript stack:

### Frontend

- React for UI components
- React Router v7 for navigation
- Supabase for authentication

### Backend

- Node.js and Express for the server
- PostgreSQL (via Supabase) for database
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting

### Development Tools

- Git for version control
- VS Code as the recommended editor
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent code formatting
