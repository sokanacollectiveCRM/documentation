# TL;DR

Overall, there exists the a decent amount of functionality for admins to manage and add doulas, and doulas entering their work hours and leaving notes. The app is basically functional (if a little bare-bones) for admins and doulas.

What's largely missing is the client's end of the app, which in an explicit form is non-existent. However, most of the interface will be the same for the client. A couple pages need to be simply retracted for their view compared to admins/doulas, along with a few client-specific features.
