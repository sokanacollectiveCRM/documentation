# Statement on Overall Purpose of Sokana CRM Project
The Sokana Collective CRM (name pending) is an ongoing development of a customized Customer Relationship Management system that integrates with the current operational flow of the Sokana Collective Doula Agency. 

As of June 1, 2025, the Sokana Collective CRM is currently on version (state version) with additional updates, including Quickbooks Integrations for invoice tracking, user payment views, and an overall overview of the material to be implemented. In addition to completing  a Doula and Client View and  Inbox Systems. 

- The app focuses on providing Sokana Collective with a replacement for their current CRM system, eDoula.biz. 
- The new CRM system offers an enhanced CRM experience, providing clients with access to their portal accounts. 
- The primary users include our clients (the admins), the Doula, and the Agencyâ€™s Clients. 

Before full deployment, the CRM must be approved by the board at Doula Agency, ensuring that all legal and patient information is secure and viable, as well as an environment that allows for data migration from the original CRM on edoula.biz. In addition to ensuring functionality for a growing user base of approximately 300 users.
